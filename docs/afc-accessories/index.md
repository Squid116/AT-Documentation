Various AFC accessories are available to enhance the functionality of your AFC system. 

Below is a list of some common accessories and their descriptions:

- AFC Bypass Sensor: This sensor allows you to bypass the AFC system for specific prints or operations, providing 
  flexibility in your printing process. It is available [here](https://github.com/ArmoredTurtle/AFC-Accessories/tree/main/AFC_Bypass).

- AT Brush: This is a gantry mounted brush that can be used to clean the nozzle during or before printing. It helps 
  maintain print quality by removing debris or residue from the nozzle. The AT Brush is available [here](https://github.com/ArmoredTurtle/AFC-Accessories/tree/main/AT_Brush).

- BTIO Board: The BoxTurtle IO (BTIO) module simplifies the integration of your BoxTurtle multi-color system with your 
  3D printer by serving as a centralized hub for all essential connections. It offers a clean, dependable interface for 
  linking the printer, connecting the toolhead buffer, and supporting daisy-chained configurations for multi-unit 
  expansion. BTIO also enables external power delivery when operating over USB. This modular design supports scalable, 
  intelligent filament handling while keeping wiring complexity to a minimum. The GitHub page is available [here](https://github.com/ArmoredTurtle/AFC-Accessories/tree/main/BTIO),
  while the actual hardware is available through LDO resellers.
