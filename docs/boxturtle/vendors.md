# BoxTurtle Sourcing & Vendors

While BoxTurtle can be mostly self-sourced, some vendors offer partial or full BoxTurtle kits. Vetted vendors are listed below, also have
dedicated vendor channels on the Armored Turtle Discord.

If you purchase a kit from a vendor not on this list, it has not been validated in any way by the ArmoredTurtle team for
either quality or completeness. For best results we recommend using a trusted vendor from the list below whenever
possible. If you are a vendor and would like to be added to this list, please open a ticket on our Discord to request
being added.

If you have questions about the legitimacy of a kit, we highly suggest you *research/ask before purchasing it*
